# Building a Facebook Messenger Bot on Hasura

This tutorial consists of a simple facebook messenger bot which, when given a movie name replies back with details about the movie along with a poster image as well as a `More Details` button. Clicking this button redirects the user to a page with more details on the movie.

For the chat bot to function we'll need a server that will receive the messages sent by the Facebook users, process this message and respond back to the user. To send messages back to the server we will use the graph API provided by Facebook. For the Facebook servers to talk to our server, the endpoint URL of our server should be accessible to the Facebook server and should use a secure HTTPS URL. For this reason, running our server locally will not work and instead we need to host our server online. In this tutorial, we are going to deploy our server on Hasura which automatically provides SSL-enabled domains.

## Pre-requisites

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

* [hasura CLI](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/install-hasura-cli.html)

## Getting the bot running

### Create a facebook application

* Navigate to https://developers.facebook.com/apps/
* Click on **'+ Create a new appâ€™**.

![Fb app screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaisontj/hasura-fb-bot/master/assets/tutorial_fb_app_screen.png "fb app screen")

* Give a display name for your app and a contact email.

![Fb app screen2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaisontj/hasura-fb-bot/master/assets/tutorial_fb_app_screen2.png "fb app screen2")

* In the select a product screen, hover over **Messenger** and click on **Set Up**

![Fb app screen3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaisontj/hasura-fb-bot/master/assets/tutorial_fb_app_screen3.png "fb app screen3")

* To start using the bot, we need a facebook page to host our bot.
  + Scroll over to the **Token Generation** section
  + Choose a page from the dropdown (Incase you do not have a page, create one)
  + Once you have selected a page, a *Page Access Token* will be generated for you.
  + Save this token somewhere.

![Page token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaisontj/hasura-fb-bot/master/assets/tutorial_fb_bot_page_token.png "Page token")

* Now, we need to trigger the facebook app to start sending us messages
  - Switch back to the terminal
  - Paste the following command:

```sh
# Replace <PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN> with the page access token you just generated.
$ curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/subscribed_apps?access_token=<PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

* In this project, we are using https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get information about the movie, to access their APIs you need an API key(v3). You can find instructions to get one [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started).

### Getting the Hasura project

```sh
$ hasura quickstart jaison/fb-bot
$ cd fb-bot
# Add FACEBOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN to secrets. This is any pass phrase that you decide on, keep a note on what you are choosing as your verify token, we will be using it later while setting things up for your bot on the facebook developer page.
$ hasura secrets update bot.fb_verify_token.key <YOUR-VERIFY-TOKEN>
# Add FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN to secrets
$ hasura secrets update bot.fb_page_token.key <YOUR-FB-PAGE-ACCESS-TOKEN>
# Add Movie db api token to secrets
$ hasura secrets update bot.movie_db_token.key <YOUR-MOVIEDB-API-TOKEN>
# Deploy
$ git add . && git commit -m "Deployment commit"
$ git push hasura master
```

After the `git push` completes:

```sh
$ hasura microservice list
```

You will get an output like so:

```sh
INFO Getting microservices...

```

Find the EXTERNAL-URL for the service named `bot`(in this case -> https://bot.apology69.hasura-app.io).

### Enabling webhooks

In your fb app page, scroll down until you find a card name `Webhooks`. Click on the `setup webhooks` button.

![Enable webhooks2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaisontj/hasura-fb-bot/master/assets/tutorial_fb_bot_enable_webhooks2.png "Enable webhooks2")

* The `callback URL` is the URL that the facebook servers will hit to verify as well as forward the messages sent to our bot. The nodejs app in this project uses the `/webhook` path as the `callback URL`. Making the `callback URL` https://bot.YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME.hasura-app.io/webhook (in this case -> https://bot.apology69.hasura-app.io/webhook/)
* The `verify token`is the verify token that you set in your secrets above (in the command $ hasura secrets update bot.fb_verify_token.key <YOUR-VERIFY-TOKEN>)
* After selecting all the `Subsciption Fields`. Submit and save.
* You will also see another section under `Webhooks` that says `Select a page to subscribe your webhook to the page events`, ensure that you select the respective facebook page here.

Next, open up your facebook page.

* Hover over the **Send Message** button and click on Test Button.

* Instead, if your button says **+ Add Button**, click on it.

![Add button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaisontj/hasura-fb-bot/master/assets/tutorial_fb_bot_page_add_button.png "Add button")

* Next, click on **Use our messenger bot**. Then, **Get Started** and finally **Add Button**.
* You will now see that the **+ Add button** has now changed to **Get Started**. Hovering over this will show you a list with an item named **Test this button**. Click on it to start chatting with your bot.
* Send a message to your bot.

Test out your bot, on receiving a movie name it should respond with details about that movie.
